However, it's interesting to note the emphasis on communication skills by recruiters. This suggests that being able to communicate effectively is highly valued in these roles. Overall, the top skills include Python, SQL, communication, data analysis, data visualization, machine learning, and more technical skills like AWS and Tableau. This indicates that a combination of technical and soft skills is essential for success in data-related roles."
